# Stack-Exchange-Title-Generator

Over 10,000 questions are asked on Stack Exchange everyday, but only 70% are answered.
The title is an important factor in attracting interest to a given question, and needs to
quickly communicate the basis of the question using appropriate keywords and tone, while not
being too generic. It's not easy to pick a good title, expecially for less-experienced users.

I'm developing a Chrome plugin that will automatically generate a strong title for your
Stack Exchange question, given the body of text. The algorithm leverages natural language processing
to summarize the key details of your question, and phrases it in a way that is consistent with
previously successful questions on similar topics. The improved title quality will make it easier
for experts to notice your question, contributing to faster, higher quality answers.
Alternatively, the algorithm could be helpful in searching for similar questions, simply by inputing
the suggested title into the existing search function on Stack Exchange.
